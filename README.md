# Project: Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a part of The Odin Project curriculum, a Tic Tac Toe game. I really learned a lot about factory function and module because of this project, my DOM skill, I feel like, improved too. The design for this project is based on my elementary days where my classmates and I will play tic tac toe on a used paper (the reason I used a crumble paper texture for the background). I am also pleased with the less global variables. I don't usually like project games but I appreciate the lessons I learned through this project.
